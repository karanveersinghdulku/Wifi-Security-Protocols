Analyzed and compared Wi-Fi security protocols, examining the evolution from WPA2 to WPA3 and their cryptographic mechanisms for securing wireless networks.

Technical Coverage -->

WPA2 Architecture: 4-Way Handshake, AES-CCMP encryption, PSK vs Enterprise (802.1X/EAP) authentication modes, PTK/GTK key derivation

WPA3 Enhancements: Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE/Dragonfly) handshake, password element derivation using hunting-and-pecking algorithm, forward secrecy implementation

Cryptographic Analysis: Elliptic curve cryptography, hash-to-curve algorithms, Protected Management Frames (PMF), key confirmation protocols

Security Vulnerabilities: KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) on WPA2, Dragonblood attacks on WPA3, downgrade and dictionary attack vectors

Live Attack Demo: Captured WPA2 handshake using Aircrack-ng suite, demonstrated offline dictionary attack exploiting MIC vulnerability, compared with WPA3's resistance to passive attacks

Demonstrated why WPA3's SAE protocol prevents offline brute-force attacks that compromise WPA2-PSK networks, emphasizing the importance of protocol upgrades for wireless network security.Collaborated with a team to analyze and compare Wi-Fi security protocols, examining the evolution from WPA2 to WPA3 and their cryptographic mechanisms for securing wireless networks.
